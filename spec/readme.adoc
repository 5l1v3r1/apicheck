This document contains the connecting protocol between ApiCheck tools. In order
to achive toolset integration you must follow this principles and protocols.

== ApiCheck

toc::[]

ApiCheck is a data driven toolset. The most important core concept is how the
data will be processed. ApiCheck only has one kind of message, the request and
response data object (ReqRes).

The ReqRes data object has the following fields:

 * request
 * response
 * extra

A valid ReqRes data object must have at least a request. Response and extra
fields are optional.

IMPORTANT: A ReqRes will be a valid json encoded object.

A ReqRes object must have allways the request. There is no response whitout
request.

=== Request
The request will encapsulate all the information in the most resumed way. The
expected fields are:

 * url: the full url required
 * version: the http version
 * method: the http method to be used
 * headers: a json object with all headers
 * body: a optional body

WARNING: Multiheaders will be encapsulated as lists.

The body will be allways a base 64 encoded string.

=== Response
The response will have the following fields:

 * status: the response status code
 * version: the http version
 * reason: optional reason
 * headers: a json object will all headers.
 * body: a optional body

WARNING: Multiheaders will be encapsulated as lists.

=== Extra
This json encoded object will hold whatever you need. Please consider keep
original fields unchanged and use extra for everything else.

== Tools as commands
Every ApiCheck tool is a command that read a ReqRes from stdin and write a
ReqRes to stdout.

With the current ReqRes form we can find the following tools:

 * Generator: writes a ReqRes to stdout
 * Transformer: reads a ReqRes from stdin and writes a ReqRes to stdout
 * Action: reads a ReqRes from stdin

TIP: On Generators and Actions you can use stdin and stdout as you want.
ApiCheck Spec only take care of ReqRes data object.

== Developer tools
To make life easier we provide several tools to help developer in their tasks.

TIP: All helper tools are focused on ReqRes data object.

=== Request enforcer
The request enforcer will use json format files to check if the format are
correct.

=== Response enforcer
The response enforcer will use json format files to check if the format are
correct.

=== Transformer helper
The most hard part is the transformer. Because requieres a complete rest server.
We encourage you to take a look on mountebank, or similar tools.
