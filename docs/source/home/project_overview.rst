Why another REST APIs tool?
---------------------------

``APICheck`` aims to be a universal toolset for REST APIs, allowing you to mix and match its commands, and even integrate with third party tools. This way we hope that it will be useful to a wide spectrum of users that need to deal with REST APIs.

We have classified our target users according to the kind of tasks they may be facing:

- :doc:`Security Engineers / Penetration Testers </uses_cases/pentesters>`
- :doc:`Developers </uses_cases/developers>`
- :doc:`System Administrators </uses_cases/sysadmins>`

The ``APICheck`` toolset is useful for the above three user profiles.

What exactly is the toolset made from?
--------------------------------------

``APICheck`` components are divided in two types:

Commands
    are small utilities.
Tools
    do more complex actions.

.. note::

    You can check the complete information about :samp:`commands` and :samp:`tools` into :ref:`Core Concepts Page for more information <apicheck_structure>`
