What is APICheck?
------------------

.. _apicheck_structure:

``APICheck`` is a **toolset** that can help you interact with REST APIs. This means the project is a collection of tools.


Why another REST APIs tool?
---------------------------

``APICheck`` aims to be a universal toolset for REST APIs, allowing you to mix and match the commands it provides, while at the same time allowing interoperability with third party tools. This way we hope that it will be useful to a wide spectrum of users that need to deal with REST APIs.

We have classified our target users according to the kind of tasks they may be facing:

- Security Engineers / Penetration Testers
- Developers
- System Administrators


Pipelines & data flow
---------------------

``API-Check`` was born as small interoperable suite of tools. Small tools with very specific function.

As \*NIX systems does, you can chain multiple commands together in a *pipeline*. Consider this one:

With ``API-Check`` you can do the same.
