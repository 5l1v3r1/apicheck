Why another REST APIs tool?
---------------------------

``API-Check`` aims to be a universal toolset for REST APIs, allowing you to mix and match its own commands and even integrate with third party tools. This way we hope will be useful to everybody that needs to use REST APIs.

Having in mind the tasks our user base have to achieve we classified them into three distinct categories:

- :doc:`Security Engineers / Pentesters </uses_cases/pentesters>`
- :doc:`Developers </uses_cases/developers>`
- :doc:`System Admins </uses_cases/sysadmins>`

The ``API-Check`` toolset is useful for the above three user profiles.

What exactly is the toolset made from?
--------------------------------------

``API-Check`` components are divided in two types:

- Commands: are small utilities.
- Tools: do more complex actions.

.. note::

    You can check the complete information about :samp:`commands` and :samp:`tools` into :ref:`Core Concepts Page for more information <apicheck_structure>`
