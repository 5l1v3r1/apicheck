Overview

What's API-Check
----------------

``API-Check`` is a **toolset** with lot of features to perform with REST API.

API-Check has structured with 3 user profiles in mind:

- :doc:`Pentesters </uses_cases/pentesters>`
- :doc:`Developers </uses_cases/developers>`
- :doc:`System Admins </uses_cases/sysadmins>`


Why another tool for REST APIs?
-------------------------------

There's a lot of tools for testing REST API:

- `TNT Fuzzer <https://github.com/Teebytes/TnT-Fuzzer>`_
- `API Fuzzer <https://github.com/KissPeter/APIFuzzer>`_
- `Tavern <https://github.com/taverntesting/tavern>`_

The main different with other tools is that ``API-Check`` is not a fuzzer or a hacking tool. There's a complete toolset of tools for testing, manage, hacking or checking a REST API.


APICheck replaces all other tools?
----------------------------------

Absolutely no! ``API-Check`` aims to be a tools that joins any other tools.
