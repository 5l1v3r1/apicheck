Command types
-------------

``API-Check`` has 2 kind of commands:

- Mini commands
- Super commands

Mini Commands
+++++++++++++

Mini commands are a small executables that have more specific things. These commands follow the \*NIX philosophy: a lot os small pieces, but that can be connected between them.

You can imagine this commands as a ``awk`` or ``grep`` commands. Small, but powerful.

Super Commands
++++++++++++++

Super commands are high level commands that join some small functionality in more *complete* command.

You can think of that as a chain of some \*NIX calls, grouped in an unique high level command. I.e:

.. code-block:: console

    > cat file.text | grep -v "MyString" | awk '{print "$2"}' | tee nmap -PN -p 443,80 -v | grep -i "Apache 2"

This example command could grouped in an *Super Command*

.. code-block:: console

    > ac-banner
