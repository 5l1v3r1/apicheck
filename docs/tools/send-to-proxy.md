# Send to proxy

This tool sends the requests read from stdin to a remote proxy.

Accepts a parameter containing the URL of the proxy to send requests to and an
option flag -q (--quiet) to supress standadr output.

If not in quiet mode it outputs the requests with the outputs obtained from the
proxy.
